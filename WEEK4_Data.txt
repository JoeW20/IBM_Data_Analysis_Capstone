The neighbourhoods in Hong Kong are from the official polling stations during 2019 district council election. This is because unlike Toronto, Hong Kong does not have postal codes, thus it is not possible to get neighbourhood information by postal codes. The official polling station are distributed uniformly around the communities where most residents live. Thus, the data are expected to be useful and effective to the neighbourhood analysis.
The Geopy package is used to obtain the location information of Hong Kong and each neighbourhood. Note that the location of some polling stations cannot be obtained by Geopy, especially for those rural regions. Considering the purposes of our neighbourhood study are mainly related to urban regions, if the data cannot be obtained by Geopy, then the neighbourhood is excluded. Finally, the 79, 113 and 214 neighbourhoods, respectively in Hong Kong island, Kowloon, and New Territories are analysed. Foursquare will be used to explore the neighbourhood further.
The neighbourhood data of Toronto and New York are from the previous course materials.
