Hong Kong is among the most developed cities around the world. As an international financial centre, Hong Kong has been performing the role of a bond between China and other countries. Thus, the city is also well known for its cultural diversity, especially the integration of Chinese and western culture. This project is to understand better the neighbourhood of Hong Kong by using Foursquare, aiming at two major problems.
Firstly, as an international city, Hong Kong attracts visitors from all cultural background and with different traveling purposes. For example, many Chinese tourists enjoy eating Dim Sum and shopping luxury in Hong Kong, while Western tourists may prefer bars and traditional Chinese cultural spots. Accordingly, when selecting hotels and arranging routes, the visitors need to know the differences between the neighbourhoods. Besides, the information may also be helpful to travel agencies and the government to make district development plans. In sum, the first problem is to learn the difference between various neighbourhoods inside Hong Kong.
Secondly, Hong Kong is the destination for university students and other high-end talents. When selecting an international university or company, the social environment is a critical factor. By comparing the neighbourhood in Hong Kong, New York and Toronto, this project will provide similarities and differences between the three multicultural cities, which help people select their working and studying city.
